SOFTWARE OR ANY TECHNOLOGY, IDEA, DATA AND DATABASES, ALGORITHMS, PRESETS, INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION
CONTAINED THEREIN OR PROVIDED THEREWITH (COLLECTIVELY, THE &ldquo;SOFTWARE”) ESTABLISHES A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN
YOU AS THE PERSON LICENSING THE SOFTWARE, EITHER ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR OF ANY THIRD-PARTY
ENTITY (&ldquo;YOU” OR &ldquo;LICENSEE”) AND IZOTOPE, INC. (&ldquo;IZOTOPE”). YOU (WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR DULY AUTHORIZED
REPRESENTATIVE OF A LEGAL ENTITY) WARRANT AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER
INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT, THAT YOU SHALL ADHERE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND

<ol>
<li>
<p>General Terms. If You purchase the Software on a subscription basis, either monthly or annual, your use of
the Software is further governed by iZotope’s Subscription Terms and Conditions (&ldquo;Subscription Terms”
<a href="https://www.izotope.com/subscription-terms">https://www.izotope.com/subscription-terms</a>), which terms are incorporated herein by this reference. In
the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Subscription Terms, the Subscription Terms shall
take precedence for subscribers; provided, however, that, with respect to the download, installation and

precedence over any other agreement between You and iZotope, including but not limited to purchase order or

<li>
<p>License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, iZotope hereby grants to You, the
Licensee, a non-exclusive license to use the Software accompanying this Agreement whether in printed,
&ldquo;online” or electronic form, either on a stand-alone computer or on a network, on any one computer at any
one time. If more than one user will be using the Software at any one time, You must obtain from iZotope
an additional license (or licenses, as applicable) for each additional concurrent user of the Software.
The Software is &ldquo;in use” on a computer when loaded into memory (RAM). You may make one copy of the
Software solely for backup or archival purposes if all copyright and other notices are reproduced on that
copy, or You may copy the Software to a single hard disk provided that You keep the original solely for
backup or archival purposes. If the Software is an upgrade, You must have a license for the Software from
which it is upgraded. If You receive the Software in more than one media, that does not affect the number
of licenses You are receiving or any other term of this Agreement.</p>
</li>

<p>Restrictions on Use. You may not modify, adapt, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the
Software, except to the extent this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law, nor may You
create derivative works based upon the Software, or permit third parties to do so. You may not loan, rent,
lease or license the Software, or use the Software as a service bureau, as an application service provider,
to perform consulting or training services for a third party or in any commercial time share arrangement,
but You may permanently transfer your rights under this Agreement provided that You transfer this
Agreement, the Software, and all accompanying printed materials and retain no copies, and the recipient
agrees to the terms of this Agreement. Any such transfer must include the most recent update and all prior
versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intellectual Property Ownership. The copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and all other

</li>
<li>
<p>Support. Subject to the limited warranty stated herein, and further subject to your not being in violation
of any term or condition of this Agreement, iZotope shall provide technical support and bug fixes,
exclusive of any upgrades or new features, for the Software to the original purchaser for a period of

<li>
<p>Limited Warranty. iZotope warrants that, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date the Software is
made available to You for download, the Software shall substantially conform to the applicable user
documentation provided with the Software. Any implied warranties that may exist despite the disclaimer
herein shall be limited to thirty (30) days (&ldquo;Warranty Period”). This limited warranty is void if You buy
from an unauthorized reseller, You violate any term or condition of this Agreement, or if the failure of
the Software is due to accident, abuse or misapplication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Remedies. iZotope’s sole obligation and your exclusive remedy for any breach of warranty shall be, at
iZotope’s sole option, either the return of the purchase price that You paid for the Software or the
repair or replacement of the Software, media and documentation; provided, however, that, in all instances,
You return the Software, together with all media and documentation and a copy of your receipt, to the
location where You obtained it during the Warranty Period. Outside the United States, neither these
remedies nor any support services are available without proof of purchase from an authorized non-US

</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT
FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH HEREIN, IZOTOPE DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IZOTOPE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE
SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. THE WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE
EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHERS, ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. No dealer, distributor, agent or
employee of iZotope is authorized to change or add to the warranty and/or remedies set forth herein. Any
third-party software furnished with or accompanying the Software is not warranted by iZotope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation Of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL IZOTOPE BE
LIABLE FOR ANY AMOUNTS EXCEEDING THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM YOU FOR YOUR LICENSE OF THE SOFTWARE,
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, AND WHETHER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES OR COSTS FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS, GOODWILL, DATA OR OTHER
ASSETS, OR COMPUTER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF IZOTOPE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some
jurisdictions do not allow exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
so this limitation may not apply to You.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License Termination. This Agreement, together with the license rights granted to You herein, shall
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, You must
immediately cease using and destroy all copies of the Software.</p>

supersede any conflicting contractual terms or conditions, except as may be set forth in the Subscription
Terms, where the U.S. Government’s use of the Software is on a subscription basis. If the license granted
