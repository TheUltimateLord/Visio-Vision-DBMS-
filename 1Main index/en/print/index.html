        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p><img src="../images/introduction.png" alt="Relay banner" />
</p>
<p>Relay is a utility plug-in that allows you to send audio information to Inter Plug-in Communication (IPC)
compatible iZotope plug-ins.</p>

        <div class="printpagebreak"></div>
    
        <h1 id="controls-and-meters">Controls and Meters</h1>
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Relay includes Peak+RMS level meters (with support for up to 7.1.2 Dolby Atmos surround
configurations), output gain, stereo balance, and stereo width controls. Relay also features an advanced controls
panel that includes channel operations processing options (Phase, Swap, Mono), channel delay controls, and an
adjustable high-pass filter.</p>
<p><img src="../images/plugin-interface.png" alt="Relay Plug-in" />

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Relay can send metering data to, or receive information from, select Inter Plug-in Communication (&ldquo;IPC&rdquo;)
compatible iZotope plug-ins. The following sections offer examples of how you can use Relay with other IPC compatible iZotope plug-ins.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="relay-and-insight">Relay and Insight</h2>
<p>Relay can send metering data to the Spectrogram and Intelligibility meters in Insight.</p>
<h3 id="insight-spectrogram-meter">Insight Spectrogram meter</h3>
<p>Up to eight Relay instances can be displayed at once in the Spectrogram meter panel in Insight.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ipc/insight-spectrogram.png" alt="Spectrogram and Relay" />
</p>
<h3 id="insight-intelligibility-meter">Insight Intelligibility meter</h3>
<p>Relay instances can be selected as a source in the Intelligibility meter panel in Insight.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ipc/intelligibility.png" alt="Intelligibility Source" />
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="relay-and-tonal-balance-control">Relay and Tonal Balance Control</h2>
<p>Relay can be selected as a source in the Tonal Balance Control plug-in.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ipc/tbc-ipc.png" alt="Relay in Tonal Balance Control" />
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="relay-and-neutron">Relay and Neutron</h2>
<p>You can use Relay as a source in the Visual Mixer, EQ Masking Meter, and Balance Assistant.</p>
<h3 id="neutron-masking-meter">Neutron Masking Meter</h3>
<p>Relay can be selected as a source in the Masking Meter feature in the Neutron
(EQ module), or in the Neutron Equalizer component plug-in.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ipc/neutron-masking-meter.png" alt="Relay in Masking meter" />
</p>
<h3 id="neutron-visual-mixer">Neutron Visual Mixer</h3>
<p>Relay controls can be remotely modified in the Neutron Visual Mixer plug-in. Moving a Relay node up or down in
the Visual Mixer will adjust the gain slider in the remote instance. Moving a Relay node left or right in the
Visual Mixer will adjust the pan control in the remote instance (stereo Relay instances only). Dragging Relay
node handles in the Visual mixer will adjust the width parameter in the remote instance (stereo Relay
instances only).</p>
<p><img src="../images/ipc/neutron-visual-mixer.png" alt="Relay in Visual Mixer" />
</p>
<h3 id="neutron-balance-assistant">Neutron Balance Assistant</h3>

<p><img src="../images/ipc/neutron-balance-assistant.png" alt="Relay in Balance Assistant" />
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="relay-and-nectar">Relay and Nectar</h2>
<p>Relay can be used as an Unmask source in Nectar Vocal Assistant. When masking is detected between the Nectar instance and the Relay instance, an EQ curve will be applied to the Relay instance in order to reduce
masking of the vocal track. When the EQ curve is active, Relay will display the track name it is unmasking.
The EQ curve can be disabled by clicking the &ldquo;Unmask&rdquo; power button in the Relay interface.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ipc/unmask.png" alt="Relay and Nectar" />
</p>
