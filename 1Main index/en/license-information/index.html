not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed
and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and
derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain
under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
