        "text": "Overview Relay includes Peak+RMS level meters (with support for up to 7.1.2 Dolby Atmos surround configurations), output gain, stereo balance, and stereo width controls. Relay also features an advanced controls panel that includes channel operations processing options (Phase, Swap, Mono), channel delay controls, and an adjustable high-pass filter.\nHeader Controls The following controls are available in the header area of the Relay plug-in.\nPlug-in Name Display Displays the name of the current Relay instance. In some DAWs and NLEs, this name will be automatically set to the name of the track Relay is inserted on. This name will appear in source selection lists of compatible iZotope plug-ins. Click on the pencil icon or directly on the text to modify the name.\nBypass Disables/enables Relay processing.\nOptions Opens the options menu panel.\nMore information\nLearn more about the Relay options menu in the Options chapter.\n Help Opens the Relay help documentation.\nControls The following controls are available in the main panel of the Relay plug-in.\nOutput Gain Adjusts the output gain of Relay. Output gain adjustments apply to all channels equally.\nWidth Adjusts the amount of stereo widening applied to the output signal. Negative values result in a narrowing effect (-100% is equivalent to mono), positive values will increase the apparent stereo field. Only functional in stereo instances of Relay.\nPan Adjusts the level of the left and right channels to affect the stereo balance of the signal. Only functional in stereo instances of Relay.\nMeters Relay can be inserted on mono, stereo, or surround tracks. The meters display Peak+RMS level information for each channel. The text readouts above the clip indicators display current peak (top readout) and RMS (bottom readout) values of a given channel. Clicking on the clip indicators will clear them.\nAdvanced Controls You can click on the Advanced button located in the bottom of the interface to show the advanced controls panel.\nThe advanced controls panel includes the following features:\nMono Sums the left and right channels to a mono output signal. Useful for testing mono compatibility. Only available in stereo instances of Relay.\nPhase Inverts the polarity of the input signal. Only available in stereo instances of Relay.\nSwap Swaps the left and right input channel outputs. Only available in stereo instances of Relay.\nTime Delay Adjusts the delay for the left or right channel. When link is enabled, values will be modified relative to each other. Double-click on the text readouts to enter values manually. Only available in stereo instances of Relay.\nHigh Pass Filter A high-pass filter (HPF) allows you to filter out frequency content below a specified cutoff frequency. The following section describes the high-pass filter controls included in the advanced panel.\nEnable Enable the high-pass filter by clicking on the power button above the small filter display.\nSlope Determines the degree of attentuation applied to frequencies below the cutoff. Change the slope of the high-pass filter by selecting a value from the dropdown menu.\nThe following Slope values are available in the High-pass filter:\n 12 dB 24 dB 48 dB  Cutoff Frequency Determines the cutoff frequency of the filter. Click and drag the node or double-click on the text readout in the bottom right hand corner of the filter display to modify the cutoff.\n",

The following sections offer examples of how you can use Relay with other IPC compatible iZotope plug-ins.\n Relay and Insight Relay can send metering data to the Spectrogram and Intelligibility meters in Insight.\nInsight Spectrogram meter Up to eight Relay instances can be displayed at once in the Spectrogram meter panel in Insight.\nInsight Intelligibility meter Relay instances can be selected as a source in the Intelligibility meter panel in Insight.\n Relay and Tonal Balance Control Relay can be selected as a source in the Tonal Balance Control plug-in.\n Relay and Neutron You can use Relay as a source in the Visual Mixer, EQ Masking Meter, and Balance Assistant.\nNeutron Masking Meter Relay can be selected as a source in the Masking Meter feature in the Neutron (EQ module), or in the Neutron Equalizer component plug-in.\nNeutron Visual Mixer Relay controls can be remotely modified in the Neutron Visual Mixer plug-in. Moving a Relay node up or down in the Visual Mixer will adjust the gain slider in the remote instance. Moving a Relay node left or right in the Visual Mixer will adjust the pan control in the remote instance (stereo Relay instances only). Dragging Relay node handles in the Visual mixer will adjust the width parameter in the remote instance (stereo Relay instances only).\nNeutron Balance Assistant Relay instances can be selected as a mix focus for the Balance Assistant feature in Neutron.\n Relay and Nectar Relay can be used as an Unmask source in Nectar Vocal Assistant. When masking is detected between the Nectar instance and the Relay instance, an EQ curve will be applied to the Relay instance in order to reduce masking of the vocal track. When the EQ curve is active, Relay will display the track name it is unmasking. The EQ curve can be disabled by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Unmask\u0026rdquo; power button in the Relay interface.\nNectar Unmask Controls Additional controls become available in the Unmask section of Relay when you are connected to an instance of Nectar Plus or Nectar Pro.\nYou can learn more about these additional unmask controls in the Vocal Assistant chapter of the Nectar help documentation.\n",
